🚀 About the Project
--------------------

This project is an **RGB ring light with a chaser animation**, built entirely from discrete electronics.
The core consists of:
* **NE555:** Clock Generator
* **CD4017:** Decade Counter
* **24 LEDs:** Positioned in Circle shape with with alternatingly positioned red, green and blue LEDs
    
The **chase speed** can be adjusted using a **10 kΩ potentiometer**.
Power is supplied through a **9 V barrel jack (5.5 mm)**.

🛠️ How It Works
===========

🔁 **Main Function**
* The **NE555** operates in astable mode, generating a variable clock signal.
* The **CD4017** advances one output pin per clock pulse.
* Each LED lights up sequentially → creating the classic **LED chaser effect**.

💡 **LED Layout**

The ring contains **24 LEDs** total:
* 🔴 **D1–D8:** Red
* 🟢 **D9–D16:** Green
* 🔵 **D17–D24:** Blue

🎚️ **Speed Control**
* A **10 kΩ potentiometer (RV1)** adjusts the NE555 frequency.

🔌 **Power Supply**
* **9 V DC input**
* Supplied through a **5.5 mm barrel jack**
